== Description ==

**WooCommerce Product Price Based on Countries** is a extension for WooCommerce that allows you to set dynamic pricing for products based on the country of your website's visitors. 

The plugin gets the country using GeoIp database and displays product price and currency you have defined previously for this country (or group of countries), if you didn't have defined a price for this country shows the regular price.

This plugin is WooCommerce 2.x compatible.

This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com.

== Installation ==

1. Download, install and activate the plugin.
1. Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Product Price Based on Country and configure as required. The first time it will download GeoIp database.
1. Go to the product page and sets the price for the countries you have configured avobe.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I Can't download the GeoIp database the first time, I get following error: "Error downloading GeoIP database from ... Service unavailable" =

MaxMind has included the IP address of your web server in a blacklist and is blocking the download.

To solve this problem you must upload the database manually to your web server following next steps:

1. Download the Maxmind database from http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb.gz
1. Decompress the file.
1. Upload the file via FTP to the web server directory *wc_price_base country* located in your wordpress uploads directory (this directory is usually */wp-content/uploads*). If *wc_price_base country* directory does not exist create it.

You can also ask MaxMind to unblock the IP address of your web server.

Note that automatic Maxmind database updates cannot be enabled until you can successfully download the database from your web server.
